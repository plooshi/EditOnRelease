# EditOnRelease
Open source edit/reset on release for all versions of Fortnite.

Can be activated via F6 or by passing -eor in command line arguments.
This functionality can also be limited to only 1 of them, via opts.h (e.g. you're implementing it in a launcher and only want to have it activate from command line)
